The goal was to create an interactive and aesthetically pleasing experience that not only serves as a reminder of this significant day but also as a symbol of ongoing progress and the enduring spirit of freedom. Through dynamic animations and thoughtful design, I aimed to capture the essence of liberation and hope, making history accessible and engaging for everyone.
